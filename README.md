# E-Commerce

## Description 

This application was created so that an user can create a database that allows them to track the items they sell. Each item can be divided by category, and they can swiftly search through their inventory. The application allows the user to work through and create inventory items. The user can input their data into 3 tables: tags, products and categories. This allows the user to organize all the items they are putting in, so that they will be able to search for items quickly. The user can use the IDs of tags, products, and categories to look for each item quicker than searching through all the items. They can update, create, and delete their tags products and categories. The item runs through the command line and uses insomnia. The user must download all the packages necessary by running the command "npm i". This will install the packages and allow them to run the application. Once the pacakges are downloaded, the user must create the database using MySQL shell by following the 'schema.sql' file in the 'db' folder. After the user has created the database, they can run the command 'npm run seed' to seed their database. If they wish to input their own data, they can run the command 'node server.js' to start the server. Once the server is started, the user can use insomnia to view and manipulate their database. A walk through video is provided below to show the steps in better detail.
